## 📂 Project Files

### 1. Car Model (`Car.blend`)
- A 3D car model created in Blender.
- Contains geometry, materials, and basic textures.
- Can be used for rendering, animation, or as a base for game assets.

### 2. Car Animation (`CarAnimation.blend`)
- Animated scene featuring the car model.
- Includes keyframes for movement and rotation.
- Useful for learning **Blender animation basics**.

### 3. Donut Model (`Donut.blend`)
- A classic Blender "Donut" project.
- Includes modeling, materials, lighting, and rendering setup.
- Great reference for **beginner Blender learning**.

### 4. Car Export (`Car.fbx`)
- Exported version of the `Car.blend` model in **FBX format**.
- Can be imported into Unity, Unreal Engine, or other 3D applications.
- Preserves geometry and materials for cross-platform use.
